# insync

Insync is a web application that uses PeerJS and the YouTube IFrame Player API to synchronize YouTube video playback across multiple users. Unlike screen sharing, which often suffers from low video and audio quality, Insync allows users to watch YouTube videos directly in their own players, ensuring high-quality playback.
